# Traditional software engineer techniques

## Methods
### Waterfall
Carry all steps that are necessary for a software development linearly. 
	- Requirements -> Design -> Implementation -> System Testing -> Operation and maintenance
	- Non iterative
	- Rigid
	- Phases are carried sequentially
### Spiral
Tries to minimize risk in the development process:
- Multiple spirals may be used concurrently for different par of the project.
- Cyclic approach for incrementally growing system's definition and implementation, while reducing risk.
How does it work:
- Determine objectives
- Identify & resolve risks
- Development & test
- Implementation
Uses same stages as waterfall, but on a cyclic way.

### Agile
Not a method but a set of principles:
- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools.
- Working software over comprehensive documentation.
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.
- Responding to change over following a plan.
- Encourages iterative and incremental development.

### Scrum
Consists of:
- Break works up into goals called sprints.
- Typically no more than 2-4 weeks per sprint.
- Stand-ups, typically daily: report on progress / plans while standing.
- Retrospective after sprints.

### Kanban

Consists of three parts:
- Backlog
- Doing 
- Done

#### Requirement Analysis
 - Figure out what software needs to do.
 - Produce Software Requirements Specification
 - Functional(how software should perform) and non Functional requirements(qualities of software)
#### Design
- Turn requirements into a software design
- Decide how the system should work
- Different levels of abstraction: architecture all the way down to how the implementation is organised.
- Considerations overlapping with non-functional requirements.

#### Implementation & unit testing

#### Integration & system testing
- Unit test exercise a small part of implementation
- Does system works as a whole?
- Do different components work together?
- Do they work with external systems?

#### Operation & maintenance
- Install and deploy the system
- Support Customers
- Make sure its running
